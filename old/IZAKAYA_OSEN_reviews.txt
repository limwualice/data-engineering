{The atmosphere is ok if you like eating outside in plastic sheeting!  The food is good used to be better before covid used to be Less crowded and better vibe all around.}

{some of the best food i've had in los angeles. really flavorful, good plates to share.}

{I recently had the pleasure of dining at Izakaya Osen, and I must say, it was an absolute delight. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality and a charming ambiance that set the tone for a memorable evening.

Let's talk about the food--I had the opportunity to savor two exceptional dishes, hotaruika and uni. Both were exquisitely prepared and left me craving for more. The hotaruika was perfect! The uni, oh my goodness! The freshness and delicate texture of the sea urchin simply melted in my mouth, leaving a heavenly aftertaste. It was an absolute feast for the senses.

I would like to extend a special congratulations to Yoshi, the Head Sushi Chef at Izakaya Osen. His expertise and culinary artistry truly shine through in every dish. The precision and care with which he crafted each morsel were truly commendable. Yoshi's passion for his craft is evident, and I consider myself lucky to have experienced his culinary mastery.

Aside from the incredible food, the service was impeccable. The staff members were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, enhancing the overall dining experience. The waitstaff made sure that every request was promptly attended to, making me feel like a valued guest throughout my visit.

Izakaya Osen has undoubtedly earned my highest recommendation. Whether you're seeking a memorable evening out or simply want to indulge in some remarkable Japanese cuisine, this is the place to be. Make sure to try the hotaruika and uni--I promise you won't be disappointed.

I would like to extend my sincere thanks and best wishes to the entire team at Izakaya Osen. May you continue to delight guests with your exceptional cuisine and warm hospitality for years to come.}

{It was Mother's Day me my mom and grandmother went hard. We popped some bottles and pregamed on some caviar and blinis. We then decided that we needed some sushi and went here with my vegan sister. As we walked in we were greeted in Japanese. I browsed the menu and was amazed because I wanted to eat just about every dish. I then decided "Fuck it" and pulled the trigger on the Omakasse sushi. Me my mom grandmother and vegan sister then devoured a variety of different food. It should
be noted my sister really likes this place so if you're. vegan you'll enjoy the food here.

Finally my Omakasse arrived and I was amazed. It was the 2nd best Omakasse experience I've had in Los Angeles. It looked perfect and tasted perfect as well. The waitress explained to me what each fish was in Japanese. I was just all "Ok" I"m just glad I recognized a few of the words from prior sushi experiences and was not totally confused! Back of house and front of house are really good at what they do here. Finally to top it all off my mom and grandmother got a complimentary rose!

This place was amazing and it was a good Mother's Day. My sister is a regular here and enjoys it as a vegan.}

{Really good! Highly recommend
Sushi and bowl are all gooood
Please make reservations beforehand}

{Price point should be closer to $$$ and not $$ and that's actually a compliment. I was in the area and was just looking for a sushi spot to eat at. I found this gem on Yelp. This is definitely a place worth dining at. Small place, intimate, and feels very traditional. I had a bit of sticker shock with the menu but once the food came out, #worth. High end delicious sushi and other awesome eats. Sushi totally melts in your mouth. Service was friendly and very efficient. I would definitely consider returning on a bigger occasion.
Tip: Be sure to join the waitlist before you arrive.}

{Came for DineLA

There is limited parking in the lot, but you can try metered street parking on Sunset or just park in the neighborhoods less than a block away.

Interiors are tight but there is also bar seating and outdoors. We got reservations and got outside seating. It's quite popular!

We did the DineLA omakase $120 each. It's a miso soup, a monkfish or oyster, a toro sashimi, a premium sashimi plate, premium sushi plate, and a mini omakase bowl. The dessert options was a green tea ice cream with match mochi pancake or a yuzu sorbet with waffle.

It was well presented! The servers told us which fish is which and recommended how to eat. For the omakase bowl we got sea trumpet seaweed paper which was good to make handrolls.

Great popular sushi place!}

{Made a last minute reservation and was seated promptly. Water was provided immediately and the menu is through a QR code. Our overall service was great.

The omakase bowl is a must-try. Everything was so fresh! The seaweed provided (to make your own little hand rolls) was unlike any seaweed I've had before and it's very unique.

I was disappointed in the kushiyaki. Ordered the beef tongue, meatballs, and chicken liver. The liver was not as tender as other place's I've tried. The beef tongue was TOUGH. It is one of my favorite meats and I was so disappointed. They were cut into chunks/cubes and that is just not the right way to serve it. Plus it was overcooked. I was struggling to slide a piece of my skewer and some pieces were even too tough to bite off.

Parking is tough. Very small lot shared with other restaurants. We were able to find metered parking on the street.}

{If you like authentic Japanese food, this is not it. The attention to detail and cookery are not there. Food was disappointing. Yakatori were all over cooked and dry. We tried gizzards, hearts, meatballs, cartilages, and chicken tail. Chicken tail contained soft bone (not just cartilages) which wasn't pleasant.
The uni toro don was nothing special and lack flavor. The seaweed was super hard.
Octopus karaage was hard to eat and dry.
The crab in the Miso crab salmon covered with too much sauce and hard to taste the crab flavor. It was as if the crab was expired so the sauce was to cover its bad flavor.
The eggplant was too sweet.

Probably the only dish I liked was the natto tofu which had a nice ponzu to help soothe the slightly normally bitter taste of natto.

The servers definitely did not look too happy working there.

Overall for this price range, the cookery needs to be better.}

{If you love sushi, but also want a variety of things to eat, this is the spot! From skewers to seafood, they have it all. Def recommend their crab with uni bowl! Flavors were amazing. Good vibes. Fast service. A little small inside, but they also have an outdoor patio with heaters. Street parking or valet is available. Can't wait to come back & try their other dishes. :)}

{Better than any of the hand roll joints in LA.

Yes, you construct your own with the bowls but I really enjoyed the toro here.

We ordered a half dozen oysters to start us off. It was so balanced with Ponzu jelly, shiso, and yuzu powder, and you can tell they really perfected this combination.

Next came our Toro uni bowl, with the standard seaweed, and our Omakase bowl, with the organic Kajime nori (the fibrous-looking one... we were all over it. These two bowls filled us up perfectly and it was such a great meal.

It's a small shop and I heard the wait could get pretty long, but we came early dinner time on a weekday and it was pretty empty.}

{Definitely a place to try if you're ever in Echo Park/Silver Lake! We've also been to their Irvine location. Both are great!

Make a reservation on line, or sit at the bar. The staff here is really nice and it's a small cozy places, fairly busy on a weekend nights. Not too loud. We always get their Omakase Bowl, 12PC Omakase (chefs choice). Every time the fish is fresh and good cut portion for the nigiri/sashimi. 10/10 recommend.

Variety of kushiyaki, hot dishes, also they have vegan friendly options for you. Don't sleep on the kama either!}

{A very popular Izakaya restaurant in this neighborhood. We came in after hubby's barber shop visit nearby. Place is tiny with cramped seatings, we chose to sit at the bar which was bit roomy.

Mobile menu was huge, alcohol list was decent. Hubby had a small bottle of Dassai 45, I had Diet Coke cause I am sober again. For food we had ankimo, rock shrimp tempura (GF), assorted nigiri sushi, skewers, spicy tuna crispy rice, salmon skin hand roll, eel cut roll and blue crab rice hot pot. The raw was very fresh and tasty. The cooked dishes were yummy but tasted so sweet. It seemed they all drenched in teriyaki or sweet mayo sauce. The portions were huge and the prices were not bad. I really liked the fast and friendly service the entire time.

We really enjoyed our Izakaya meal and we don't mind visiting again whenever we are in this area!

Ps. NO parking in this area, valet only!}

{Walked in at 3:30pm Thursday without a reservation. Place was a bit empty. Service was okay.

- Blue Crab Uni Bowl 5/5
Comes with seaweed to make your own tiny wraps, IT IS DELICIOUS. The blue crab tastes so fresh and so good. The uni wasn't the freshest and had a bit of a weird taste to it.

- Salmon Skin Hand Roll 4/5
Salmon Skin was very crispy.

- Beef Tongue 5/5
TASTES so good. Comes in these cube pieces.

- Chicken Skin 5/5
Crispy chicken skin.

- Cartilage 5/5
Cartilage surrounded by meat, it was actually my favorite thing along with the beef tongue.

- Bacon Enoki Mushroom 4/5
Basic bacon and Mushroom.

Parking is NOT free. Valet is $7. Accepts venmo or zelle.}

{I recently visited for a weekday lunch and was blown away by the quality of the food and the great value of the lunch menu.

The sushi and sashimi were some of the freshest I've had, and the chefs clearly take great care in selecting only the best fish for their dishes. I especially loved the stripped jack, which practically melted in my mouth.

Another standout for me were the skewers. The meat selection was top-notch, with everything from prime beef, beef tougue, to pork belly. Each skewer was perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. I couldn't get enough!

The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, making it the perfect spot for a casual lunch or a date night.

Overall, I highly recommend this Japanese restaurant for anyone looking for delicious, authentic Japanese food. You won't be disappointed!}

{I recently had the pleasure of dining at Izakaya Osen, and it was truly an exceptional experience. We came here for Saturday night dinner with some friends, and would definitely recommend coming here with a few people to try out their different dishes!

First and foremost, the atmosphere of Izakaya Osen was elegant yet welcoming, with a sleek and modern design that felt both sophisticated and comfortable. The staff was friendly and attentive, making me feel right at home from the moment I walked in the door.

Every dish I tried had great flavor, texture, and presentation. From the soft hamachi kama, to the melt-in-your-mouth salmon, each bite was a such a treat. Even the yakitori skewer dishes, were grilled perfectly and had a great smokey flavor to them. My favorite was their Toro Uni bowl (pic attached) - the fresh quality of the seafood really shined in this dish!

Overall, I recommend Izakaya Osen to anyone looking for a delicious meal to share with friends!}

{One of my favorite casual sushi spots in LA! Everything is always super fresh and flavorful. Quality is always consistent each time I visit, which I super appreciate. Plus, I haven't found a dish I don't like yet! Good for takeout too, just make sure you order ahead of time. Location/parking is a little hard but so worth it :-)}

{So much variety of Japanese food! And they all taste great too. We ended up ordering little too much. This was second time going there for my bday. The green tea ice cream + cake dessert was delicious too! Highly recommend going here for social occasion unless you have the kind of money that celebrities have to dine at this type of restaurant for regular meals.}

{Made a reservation for two on Saturday night and we got a bar table so we get the front row seat to the chefs grilling some yummy skewers!

We ordered...

Skewers

- Beef tongue (5/5) - so tender and smoky!
- Chicken meatballs (5/5) - flavour bomb, high recommend
- chicken thighs w/ green onion (4/5) - reallyyy good and juicy, love the char on it
- Bacon asparagus (4/5)

NABE!

Unagi Hotpot (5/5) - another worthwhile dish that comes in big pot. I devoured this! could serve 3 people, but my friend and i finished this in no time. the rice cooked in sauce is smoky, and umami. The server mixed it for us in the hot stone pot. the eel is soft, it melts in your mouth. so delicious!
Beef Tantan Nabe (5/5) - Generous portion of beef brisket The udon was not over cooked, and the broth was so flavourful without being too thick or salty, which I usually come across when the broth is pork-based. But this one great. HUGE portion for all their rice and nabe, so worth it.

we also tried their roll with spicy tuna, and it was so good! Personally, I like when spiny tuna has the spice kick to it. Usually in spicy tuna I find in most restraurant tends to be more mellow and has too much mayo than spice, but Osen nailed it!

Parking - They have valet, but we found street parkings, so we saved $10 for more skewers haha.
Service - 10/10 helpful and friendly staffs, they explain to us the menu and give us great recommendations, they also try their best to accomodate us on the bar table, cus we ordered a lot of stuffs...

I'm definitely coming back here, it's also a great place to dine alone if you like that.}

{What a yummy Izakaya restaurant.  It came highly recommended by our friends and definitely did not disappoint.  

All the seafood dishes were so delicious and fresh.  Loved everything that had Uni, blue crab and unagi!  We had four people and over ordered a bit because everything looked so good that we just had to try them all!

The Omakase bowl was a nice mixture of fish, Uni, blue crab, and salmon roe.  Absolutely loved the Kajime nori provided to use as a seaweed wrapping paper.  

The blue crab Uni bowl was a must because it contained two of my faves.  The unagi rice hot pot was also nicely prepared and flavorful.  

The Uni Scallop Carpaccio and Ankimo Uni Caviar were both to die for and tasted simply amazing!  

A fail for me was the Rock Shrimp Tempura which was overly battered and looked like a hot mess mixed with spicy aioli sauce.

This place isn't cheap but I left with my tummy full, happy and satisfied!}

{2nd time here and the food was ok at best. We started off with vegetable gyoza and eggplant. Eggplant was good gyoza was ehh... didn't taste fresh.

I ordered the beef tantan udon and the broth wasn't that flavorful. Also the uni bowl is NOT a uni bowl. It's an ikura bowl with 1 piece of uni on top. What a disappointment. The unagi bowl was super sweet and the rice was mushy.

The service with some of the servers was good but others was really bad. One guy in particular, he was so rude. We asked for validation and he snapped at us. Takes the tickets for validation then just gives it without looking at us.}

{I love this place so much, it's currently my #1 go to for sushi. I've been numerous times already, and I highly recommend making reservations in advance, or else you'll be waiting in line for a good hour or two.

I always get the toro uni bowl and skewers, but most importantly toro nigiri! Their price point is AMAZING for the quality of the toro. You won't be disappointed.

The servers are usually nice except I had a really bad encounter with one of the Korean servers who I asked for the status of my skewer because everyone else's at the table came out 15 min ago. She said "it's really busy you gotta wait DONT WORRY it's coming". Then, we saw her bringing back the skewers she was originally taking to another table and told me "it's here it's here". It was clearly her mistake with the table order mix up but I didn't even bother. She ended up forgetting our karaage order too and we had to cancel it.

Aside from the fact that I had to dock off a star because of that server, the food never disappoints so I still highly recommend.}

{Dang, I'm obsessed with the place. I can't even begin to describe how amazing this place is. The sushi they serve is so delicious and very fresh. The tuna sashimi we got was heavenly. Absolutely get the sushi bowls they offer, especially the toro uni bowl. Hamachi collar was so tender and fatty. Also not pictured was the blue crab hot pot we got and it was indeed very good, as you guessed. Dessert was a perfectly not-too-sweet matcha mochi cake with black sesame ice cream. Not a single bite wasn't up to standard.

Service was fantastic and incredibly attentive. This location is their original and is a small little cute izakaya. They have a new location in Irvine that is more modern if that's more your vibe. They also offer an omakase, which i'd love to try. I can't say enough good things. Honestly no complaints at all, just go here if you love all things Japanese food and you can thank me and yourself later!! Cant wait to be back!}

{The Beef Nabe was very, very flavorful. Toro Unagi Bowl was good, and the Maguro Kajime was probably my least favorite - but partially my fault, i didn't expect the seared bluefin to still be warm, for some reason. My girlfriend ordered the Potato dish off the Salad menu - which was unfortunately, just American potato salad. Kinda threw us off lmao.

Service/Authenticity was 10/10. I'll come back, for the Nabe鍋and the Sashimi刺身。

Fish is very fresh.}

{PARKING IS SO TRASH

but the service and food is soooooo good
me and my bf made reservation for 6:30 and it took us over 30 mins to park so we almost didn't get seated but thankfully they were kind enough to give us an outdoor table

we ordered the A5 wagyu gyozas for starters, and the albacore with truffle oil & fried onions + the agedashi tofu
the A5 wagyu gyozas were sooooooo good the absolute best gyozas i've ever had litcherlyyyy

we ordered sm yakitori everything was so amazing
we ordered pork belly, prime beef, beef tongue, bacon w enoki mushroom, and eggplant
the yakitori was all very good but our favorite was definitely the pork belly

for sushi we ordered salmon, hokkaido scallop, albacore, uni, amaebi, tamago, eel and kanpachi
EVERYTHING WAS SO FUCKING GOOD
the kanpachi was definitely my favorite cus the texture was amazing and flavor was bomb! i loved the yuzu wasabi they put on top
the salmon was also incredibly rich and tasty, i think it was my bf's favorite

we also got the toro and uni bowl to end the meal and it was great and i loved it sm but we were so full and had to pack it home

definitely loved everything we had and ill try out the irvine location next time
highly recommend to anyone in the area and wants some good food}

{Even with reservations there will be a wait because this place is super popular and packed!  Parking is terrible too. They have valet but it gets full fast and plan on parking 10-15 minutes walk away.  Restaurant is small.

But the food makes up for it because it was amazing.  

Skewers: pork belly, prime beef, beef tongue, lamb chop, bacon wrapped shrimp, Japanese pork sausage, pork rib, Seabass, salmon, and grilled oysters.

The best were the pork belly, beef tongue, prime beef, and Seabass.
I didn't like the salmon and pork rib.

Also ordered:
Agedashi tofu - okay, nothing special
Fresh oysters - very good
Miso glazed eggplant - surprise hit
Octopus karaage- yummy
Sashimi salad - lots of sashimi and dressing was very good
Blue crab hot pot - so rich and delicious. Tons of crab}

{If you're on yelp trying to decide to go, definitely go!

If you're trying to decide what to get, I'd definitely say go sashimi because fish was fresh, but also one of the hot bowls because it was fun to assemble lil hand rolls yourself. Not only fun but very yummy.

Delicious, so yummy, kind service who were helpful, and good vibes! I really liked the cute dishes. The interior was small but felt cozy and I enjoyed it a lot. I came with a party of four and the ambiance was chill enough to have a good time with everyone. The sushi was fresh!! We had really good sashimi, unfortunately I'm not sure what we got but it was salmon, toro, and something else. So delicious! I've never had it cut like this but it was good. If you like uni.....definitely get--and they DO NOT skimp out!!!!

Definitely worth checking out!}

{This place is one of my favorite restaurants in LA!
They are always serving the freshest and delicious fish. I decided to get their sashimi omakase which comes with 18 pieces of chef's choice premium sashimi assortments.
Every single piece was amazing but my favorite was the otoro. Also the presentation is stunning!}

{Great quality fish and service! Although pricey for the quantity, I will admit that every bite is delicious. I think their sushi is better than their yakitori.

They have indoor and outdoor seating which is nice because they're pet friendly. Parking is limited, but not too bad. Haven't had an issue waiting for parking yet.}

{The chicken skin skewer is my fav. Other than that, service is decent. The only thing I missed out is becoz I was late for half and hour, didn't get chance to sit indoor.}
