       "\"\\n\\nThis person had a bad experience at Pine Street Pizza, where they were only offered plain or pepperoni slices and the pizza was lukewarm and rubbery. They prefer NYPD Pizza and Mama Angelina's, and have had good experiences with takeout from Pine Street Pizza in the past. However, they had a bad experience with the white pizza with broccoli and breaded mushrooms, and would not recommend it. They also noted that the pizza is smaller than most in the area, but the slightly lower pricing makes up for it. Additionally, they warned to check for mold growths on the bottom of the pizza before eating. The shop has its regulars, and service is prompt with minimal wait time for food. The white anchovy pizza is a favorite, and the cheese ravioli comes with a generous portion of garlic bread. It is also conveniently located across the street from Giovanni's Room. The gyros are also tasty, and it is a popular stop for cops in the area. The strombolis are also great, and the mozz sticks are a favorite. Delivery is not recommended, as the pizza arrives cold. The pizza is different with a crisp buttery crust, and the owner recently passed away, so it is unclear how staff will change.\""
