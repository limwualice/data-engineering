The Head Sushi Chef, Yoshi, is highly skilled and passionate about his craft. The restaurant is highly recommended for a memorable evening out or for indulging in some remarkable Japanese cuisine. Prices are on the higher end, but the quality of the food is worth it. Limited parking is available in the lot, but metered street parking and parking in the neighborhoods less than a block away are also options. Interiors are tight but there is also bar seating and outdoors. The DineLA omakase is a must-try, with a miso soup, a monkfish or oyster, a toro sashimi, a premium sashimi plate, premium sushi plate, and a mini omakase bowl. The dessert options include a green tea ice cream with match mochi pancake or a yuzu sorbet with waffle. The servers are knowledgeable and provide great service. If you love sushi, but also want a variety of things to eat, this is the spot! From skewers to seafood, they have it all. Better than any of the hand'"
