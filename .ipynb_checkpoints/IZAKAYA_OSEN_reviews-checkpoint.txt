{some of the best food i've had in los angeles. really flavorful, good plates to share.}

{I recently had the pleasure of dining at Izakaya Osen, and I must say, it was an absolute delight. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality and a charming ambiance that set the tone for a memorable evening.

Let's talk about the food--I had the opportunity to savor two exceptional dishes, hotaruika and uni. Both were exquisitely prepared and left me craving for more. The hotaruika was perfect! The uni, oh my goodness! The freshness and delicate texture of the sea urchin simply melted in my mouth, leaving a heavenly aftertaste. It was an absolute feast for the senses.

I would like to extend a special congratulations to Yoshi, the Head Sushi Chef at Izakaya Osen. His expertise and culinary artistry truly shine through in every dish. The precision and care with which he crafted each morsel were truly commendable. Yoshi's passion for his craft is evident, and I consider myself lucky to have experienced his culinary mastery.

Aside from the incredible food, the service was impeccable. The staff members were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, enhancing the overall dining experience. The waitstaff made sure that every request was promptly attended to, making me feel like a valued guest throughout my visit.

Izakaya Osen has undoubtedly earned my highest recommendation. Whether you're seeking a memorable evening out or simply want to indulge in some remarkable Japanese cuisine, this is the place to be. Make sure to try the hotaruika and uni--I promise you won't be disappointed.

I would like to extend my sincere thanks and best wishes to the entire team at Izakaya Osen. May you continue to delight guests with your exceptional cuisine and warm hospitality for years to come.}

{It was Mother's Day me my mom and grandmother went hard. We popped some bottles and pregamed on some caviar and blinis. We then decided that we needed some sushi and went here with my vegan sister. As we walked in we were greeted in Japanese. I browsed the menu and was amazed because I wanted to eat just about every dish. I then decided "Fuck it" and pulled the trigger on the Omakasse sushi. Me my mom grandmother and vegan sister then devoured a variety of different food. It should
be noted my sister really likes this place so if you're. vegan you'll enjoy the food here.

Finally my Omakasse arrived and I was amazed. It was the 2nd best Omakasse experience I've had in Los Angeles. It looked perfect and tasted perfect as well. The waitress explained to me what each fish was in Japanese. I was just all "Ok" I"m just glad I recognized a few of the words from prior sushi experiences and was not totally confused! Back of house and front of house are really good at what they do here. Finally to top it all off my mom and grandmother got a complimentary rose!

This place was amazing and it was a good Mother's Day. My sister is a regular here and enjoys it as a vegan.}

{Really good! Highly recommend
Sushi and bowl are all gooood
Please make reservations beforehand}

{Price point should be closer to $$$ and not $$ and that's actually a compliment. I was in the area and was just looking for a sushi spot to eat at. I found this gem on Yelp. This is definitely a place worth dining at. Small place, intimate, and feels very traditional. I had a bit of sticker shock with the menu but once the food came out, #worth. High end delicious sushi and other awesome eats. Sushi totally melts in your mouth. Service was friendly and very efficient. I would definitely consider returning on a bigger occasion.
Tip: Be sure to join the waitlist before you arrive.}

{Came for DineLA

There is limited parking in the lot, but you can try metered street parking on Sunset or just park in the neighborhoods less than a block away.

Interiors are tight but there is also bar seating and outdoors. We got reservations and got outside seating. It's quite popular!

We did the DineLA omakase $120 each. It's a miso soup, a monkfish or oyster, a toro sashimi, a premium sashimi plate, premium sushi plate, and a mini omakase bowl. The dessert options was a green tea ice cream with match mochi pancake or a yuzu sorbet with waffle.

It was well presented! The servers told us which fish is which and recommended how to eat. For the omakase bowl we got sea trumpet seaweed paper which was good to make handrolls.

Great popular sushi place!}

{Made a last minute reservation and was seated promptly. Water was provided immediately and the menu is through a QR code. Our overall service was great.

The omakase bowl is a must-try. Everything was so fresh! The seaweed provided (to make your own little hand rolls) was unlike any seaweed I've had before and it's very unique.

I was disappointed in the kushiyaki. Ordered the beef tongue, meatballs, and chicken liver. The liver was not as tender as other place's I've tried. The beef tongue was TOUGH. It is one of my favorite meats and I was so disappointed. They were cut into chunks/cubes and that is just not the right way to serve it. Plus it was overcooked. I was struggling to slide a piece of my skewer and some pieces were even too tough to bite off.

Parking is tough. Very small lot shared with other restaurants. We were able to find metered parking on the street.}
